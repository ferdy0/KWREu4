The Council, always ready to expand their influence, have chosen the closest relative in line, which is none other than the King of Africa. He is currently on the way to Cagliari for the coronation ceremony, but our local nobles are openly opposing this decision, quoting the fact that our new ruler will be Levantine, and angry about that new power grab by the Council. \nIt seems that the situation is spiraling out of control, and the nobles are starting an open rebellion, calling other Lacon-Gunale branches for help in Naples and Provence. The King of Africa quickly converting to Catholicism didn't help..."

 tyrhennia_civil_war.9.d:0 "With the civil war spiraling out of control, even the all-mighty Council has decided to send their private militia to try to help quell the revolts.

 tyrhennia_civil_war.12.t:0 "The Secret Conversion"
 tyrhennia_civil_war.12.d:0 "With the War of the Doves now behind us, it seems now that the king of Africa, and now our king, had not actually converted to Catholicism, and used all these years of peace to slowly and discreetly convert the upper classes of society to Levantine.

The Greeks denigrated these realms as the 'Frankokratia', the rule of the 'Franks', but for us, they were useful tools for extending our power. It was a grand time to be a Venetian. The time is ripe to re-establish our presence in Constantinople, the real center of power in the area, but this time we should play a more active role in the region's administration."

 flavor_ven.44.t:0 "The Power of the Doge"
 flavor_ven.44.d:0 "Francesco Foscari's leadership as Doge of Venice from 1423 to 1457 was a period of both accomplishments and challenges. His rule oversaw Venice's territorial expansion in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean, enhancing its maritime and trade influence. However, it was also marked by internal conflicts and growing discord among the city's elite. Foscari's persistent pursuit of war against the Republic of Milan strained Venice's resources, while the influential Council of Ten encroached on his authority, leading to the banishment of his own son for corruption. In 1457, Foscari resigned and died in exile, a poignant episode that inspired literary and artistic works, most notably Lord Byron's play The Two Foscari.\n\nThe authority of Venice's Doges underwent a significant transformation through the centuries. In the early days of the Venetian Republic, these leaders wielded substantial political and military power. However, by the 15th century, their role had shifted to become more symbolic and ceremonial, as the influential Council of Ten, responsible for state security matters, increasingly constrained the Doge's decision-making. The Doge's duties centered on representing Venice in formal settings, receiving foreign envoys, and presiding over ceremonies. Actual political influence lay dispersed among various councils, noble families, and institutions like the Great Council, embodying Venice's distinctive system of governance characterized by checks and balances, ensuring that no single figure, even the Doge, could exercise absolute authority and thereby fostering stability and averting authoritarian rule."

 flavor_ven.45.d:0 "The construction of the Doge's Palace in Venice began in the 9th century and continued throughout the subsequent centuries. Originally conceived as a fortress-like edifice, the palace evolved over time into a magnificent representation of Venetian Gothic architecture. This architectural marvel served the dual purpose of being both the residence of the Doge, the preeminent political leader of the Venetian Republic and housing various government offices and courts.\n\nBy the 16th century, the Doge's Palace had undergone substantial renovations and expansions, resulting in a significant augmentation of its grandeur. One of the most remarkable developments was the completion of its iconic façade, which faced the Grand Canal, showcasing the palace's architectural splendor to all who approached by water. This period of renovation and expansion further solidified the palace's status as an enduring symbol of Venetian power and authority. Its halls and chambers, characterized by intricate designs and opulent decorations, not only bore witness to centuries of political activities but also stood as an enduring testament to the city's rich history and continued significance on the global stage."

 flavor_ven.46.d:0 "During the 15th and 16th centuries, theater in Venice was a vibrant and influential cultural phenomenon. The city was home to some of the earliest permanent theaters in Europe, such as the Teatro di San Cassiano, which opened in 1637, and the Teatro Olimpico, designed by Andrea Palladio in 1580. These venues hosted a wide range of theatrical performances, including plays, operas, and comedies, attracting both locals and tourists. Venice's unique position as a major maritime and trading hub allowed for the exchange of artistic ideas and influences from across Europe, contributing to the development of Venetian theater as a rich and diverse form of entertainment that played a pivotal role in the history of European drama and performance arts."

 flavor_ven.47.d:0 "In [GetYear], the Academy, known as the 'Incogniti,' has drawn influential literary figures both within and beyond Venice who align with a libertine agenda and advocate for the city's political and cultural independence. Figures like Girolamo Brusoni and Ferrante Pallavicino, among others, are associated with this covert group, marked by its use of subterfuges like paradox and allegory to avoid criticism. Operating discreetly, members often employ secret language and publish anonymously, with their philosophy influenced by Trajano Boccalini, embracing Aristotelian naturalism from the University of Padua.\n This clandestine academy, despite facing censorship and finding its works on the Index, boldly challenges societal norms through satirical compositions and hybrid genres. Shaped by the ideologies of Machiavelli, Paolo Sarpi, and others, they critique tyranny in historical writings. Surprisingly, the Accademia degli Incogniti becomes a key force in advancing musical theatre in Venice, establishing the Teatro Novissimo."

These oaths included commitments to administer justice impartially, uphold state secrets, and execute decisions of the Great Council. They also imposed constraints on the Doge's powers, such as prohibiting direct correspondence with foreign leaders and interference in the election of the Patriarch of Venice. Over time, the promissione became increasingly comprehensive and was eventually printed, with documents for different Doges growing in length, ranging from 108 to 301 pages. To prevent the office from becoming hereditary, restrictions extended to the Doge's relatives, barring them from certain councils and positions. Although some restrictions were eased in the later years of the Venetian Republic, significant limitations remained in place, even for the Doge's family members. The oaths also included provisions regarding the Dogaressa, including her attire and ceremonial duties."
