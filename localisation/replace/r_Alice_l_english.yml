 confucianism_religion_desc:0 "With the collapse of the Zhou Dynasty, many different polities sprung up across the lands of the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers.

These various streams of thought would intermix with each other along with the new faith taking hold across the Tibetan Plateau, resulting in a diverse blend of teachings compiled within the various state canons across the Middle Kingdom and beyond."
