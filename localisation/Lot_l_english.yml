 lot_flavor_boh.1.d:0 "Attempts at enforcing the religious peace between Hussites and Catholics have broken down despite our best efforts. Jirí z Podebrad, leader of the Hussite faction, has raised an army and now marches of Prague. He means to make himself King of Bohemia and secure religious freedom for the followers of Hus."

 bohemia_devotion_legitimacy_horde_unity_desc:0 "For over three centuries, and since its inception as a hereditary kingdom, the Kingdom of Bohemia has been the sole domain of the house of Luxemburg.

 bohemia_infantry_combat_and_shock_reduced:0 "Wagenburg"
 bohemia_infantry_combat_and_shock_reduced_desc:0 "During the Hussite wars our armies relied on wagon forts, which would allow us to win battles we should have lost. Although we may not always use wagons, using infantry sharp shooters from defensive positions will become the tactic of choice for our ever invincible Bohemian armies."

 bohemia_global_unrest_desc:0 "The Hussite wars have left a legacy of dangerous divisions on ecclesiastical matters in the land.

Being in close proximity to the many silver and gold mines of Europe, mining requires stricter regulation in the times of the Bullion famine."

 armenia_dev_cost:0 "Mountainous Homeland"
 armenia_dev_cost_desc:0 "The Armenian people have, for many centuries, lived within the Caucasian mountains and, as such, have learned numerous adaptions to their unorthodox terrain. Where others may see a vista at best and an inhospitable wasteland at worst, those familiar with the land van imagine entire cities nestled between where these rocky spires of the earth part; cathedrals and palaces alike now dot the landscape, their stone taken from the very mountains which surround them. Both granting access to the bounty of the earth and defending against invaders with unlimited endurance and loyalty. What once was a hinderance has now become Armenia's greatest ally."
 armenia_tolerance_true_faith:0 "Primacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church"
 armenia_tolerance_true_faith_desc:0 "Like few other states have achieved, unity in religion in Armenia has been arduously brought about after centuries of conversion, yet now the results can finally be observed. Temporal and spiritual life grow closer by the day, and the Apostolic Church funds palaces just as lords and nobles fund grand cathedrals. Even the capital of Kapan is home to one such holy endeavour, with the court's movement to the city in 1142 a direct result of this construct done in the name of faith. As the country's estates all pray as one, there is no question as to the utterly dominant status of the one true faith in Armenia."
 armenia_regiment_cost:0 "Nakharar Restoration"
 armenia_regiment_cost_desc:0 "Every feudal kingdom needs a hierarchy; every hierarchy needs a nobility; every nobility needs a hierarchy of its own; and for Armenia it is the Nakharars who occupy that prized position. Possessing vast estates and differing from their European counterparts in their particularly endogamic practices, their power is matched by few in Armenian society. Although greatly weakened by Byzantine and Mongol rule, Armenian independence has ushered in a resurgence in Nakharar privileges and importance. Particularly their martial role, stripped from them by Justinian's tyranny and now restored to its former glory. Capable of mustering grand armies and holding integral titles such as sparapet -the commander of the kingdom's armed forces- they are a force to be reckoned with, both within and without the country."
 armenia_fort_defense:0 "Sghnakhs in Every Valley"
 armenia_fort_defense_desc:0 "To conquer Armenia is to herd cats; is to search for needles in a haystack; is to embark upon a wild goose chase. Whichever metaphor is employed in this comparison there is no doubt that subjugating this mountainous kingdom is a foolhardy and impossible task. However mountains alone do not make a land impenetrable. Between these mountains lie valleys and it is therefore of utmost importance that these valleys are defended vigorously. Operated by Meliks -a largely independent feudal landowing class charged with the rule of the mountains- sghnakhs serve as fortresses, mustering grounds, and sentry towers all rolled into one. They are the first line of defense in Armenia, and in over a century they have yet to fall."
 armenia_goods_produced:0 "The Diaspora's End; The Beginning of the Return"
 armenia_goods_produced_desc:0 "There are numerous diasporic peoples, and a consistent aspect of all of them is the seeming inability to return home. In recent times, however, it seems that Armenia has defied this precedent. Scattered across former Byzantium the Armenian populace strechtes from the Mediterranean to the verge of the Caspian. In particular due to the Seljuk invasions and simultaneous Byzantine atrocities many found a new home in Cilicia on the border of the region of Greater Armenia. Now, however, pressured by attempts at conversion by Jerusalemite conquerors, many have made their way northward, back to the homeland they once fled. It seems that with every new attempt made by foreign princes to control the diaspora more and more make the trek to their ancestral birthplace, providing yet more boons for the kingdom."
 armenia_national_tax:0 "Loyal Meliks"
 armenia_national_tax_desc:0 "A simple fact of geography made evident to any would-be conquerors of the Caucasus is that they are simply impossible to directly control. Even the brief Mongol reign was conducted through the fealty of local rulers, with the word of the Khan diluted several times before reaching its recepients. This, however, is no detriment at all. Whereas others may curse the mountains for obstructing their control, the kings of Armenia have constructed a delicately balanced network of semi-independent vassals known as Meliks, creating a system of such efficiency it at times rivals that of centralised states. These Meliks -some of the first to fight against Seljuk rule and often the most adamant force for Armenian independence- are the method through which the unconquerable has been brought to heel. Not through force and violence, but through efficient and rational governance."
 armenia_national_manpower:0 "The Great Ishkhans"
 armenia_national_manpower_desc:0 "While the Nakharars may be the highest of the nobility, Armenian society goes higher still. At the very top of this hierarchy within a hierarchy within a hierarchy lie the Ishkhans, princes of great renown and authority. De jure second only to the king, yet often de facto wielding greater jurisdiction in localised areas, they are often capable of fending off foreign attacks on their own, and in exchange for such great autonomy and power provide portions of their mighty hosts to the king himself. Holding dominion over networks of Meliks and at times even other Nakharars of their own, they are often found occupying positions as the king's highest advisors, serving their due part in commanding the ship of state."

 france_discipline_desc:0 "Created by Charles V in May 1445, they are considered the first permanent armies. Controlled by the king himiself, the main goals of the Compagnies d'Ordonnance were better efficacy in war and a reduction of plunders and lootings. Each company was composed of 100 lances with assisting pages, squires, archers and men-at-arms. The compositions evolved through the ages to whatever suited warfare best."

They find their origins in the best mercenary bands at the French frontiers: Swiss bands, Landesknechte, Reuters, Spanish tercios, Italian mercenaries... Each of these regiments had infantry regiments under its command."

 france_state_governing_cost_desc:0 "L'Ordonnan du Roy sur la Justice (King's Ordinance on Justice) was signed into action in August 1539. The major goal of this ordinance was to discontinue the use of Latin in official documents. Thanks to this the French language became the language of the administration, after becoming the language of diplomacy. In addition the legislation also asked churches to keep vital registers. The principal effect of this ordinance is the reduction of regional-language speakers and making France into a more unified and centralised state."
 france_trade_and_native:0 "Coureurs des Bois"
 france_trade_and_native_desc:0 "Decisive in the French colonial project in North America, the "Coureurs des Bois" (Wood Runners) were settlers driven by the hope of finding gold and furs. Going up the tributaries of the Mississippi, the Coureurs set up trade posts and integrated native communities. By learning their language and sometimes marrying them, they greatly helped French settlers install their colonies."
 france_missionary_strength_vs_heretics:0 "Les Dragonnades"
 france_missionary_strength_vs_heretics_desc:0 "The Edict of Nantes, of 1598, ended the Religious wars in France. By granting political and military privileges, the Edict greatly reduced protestant upset and brought peace through France. Everything could have stayed that way but two generations later the king's grandson aimed at religious uniformity in his kingdom. After offering financial incentives to convert, he decided, in 1681, to take a more active stance. By billeting dragoons and infantrymen in protestant homes with an order to harass and intimidate occupants, the policy was undoubtedly more effective than the diplomatic route of his grandfather. A few years and some burned churches later the Huguenots massively fled to Switzerland, Germany, and the Low Countries."
 france_admin_and_advisor_cost:0 "Les Chambres de Réunions"
 france_admin_and_advisor_cost_desc:0 "The Chambers of Reunion has only one purpose: increase French territory. After a series of victorious wars, the court's job was to determine what dependencies belonged to the areas incorporated into the France. All of the claims were based on ancient, often long-forgotten, rights to territories in Germany, stemming from the middle ages."
