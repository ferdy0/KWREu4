 Whaling_1_mission_title:0 "The whalers of Norway" 
 Whaling_1_mission_desc:0 "For centuries whaling has been an integral part of the Norwegian way of life. But in the past few decades, the crown has shown more and more intresting in this industry, with the culmination of this being the monopolisaton of the whaling industry by the crown into the NKV." 
 F_M_1_mission_title:0 "The mines of Dalaskogen" 
 F_M_1_mission_desc:0 "The copper mines of Dalaskogen have been the economic center of our kingdom for centuries, producing most of the copper used within northern Europe and making us many riches. To expand on this success the crown has authorized the expansion of the mines into the surounding area." 
 Trade_1_mission_title:0 "The Northsea Trade" 
 Trade_1_mission_desc:0 "With our posesions all over the Northsea and our vassal of Iceland, the trade between them has only grown over the past centuries. We must make a final push to fully link the Northern Isles and Iceland to the mainlaind European economy. We will achieve this with the adoption of a new type of ship, the Caravel" 
 Whaling_2_mission_title:0 "Bigger ships, Bigger fish" 
 Whaling_2_mission_desc:0 "With the monopoly now firmly established, we must look into expanding the extraction rates of the industry. The easiest way to do this is to use our newly invented Caravels to increase the range and speed of our whaling fleet and allow it to catch bigger amounts of whales" 
 Navy_1_mission_title:0 "The great northern fleet" 
 Navy_1_mission_desc:0 "With our domain reaching out across the northern atlantic, we must have a fleet big and capable enough to defend all of our island posesions aswell as the long coast of mainland Norway" 
 F_M_2_mission_title:0 "Bigger mines mean more wood" 
 F_M_2_mission_desc:0 "With the recent expansion of the Dalakogen mines, we now face a wood shortage. The extra tunnels that are being dug need wood for support beams, and the extra ore extraction needs to be spelted in furnaces with the help of charcoal. The crown has set out to expand forresting operations in the great forrests of eastern Norway." 
 Conquest_1_mission_title:0 "Reconquer lost lands" 
 Conquest_1_mission_desc:0 "With the Swedish incursions of the early 1400s, we lost some borderlands. This must be rectified" 
 Trade_2_mission_desc:0 "With our Northsea posesions now firmly integrated into the greater European economy, we must set our sights on the Baltic trade around the free city of Lübeck. This is after all where most of our goods flow too. We can either take some of this trade with agressive practices, or ally ourselves with the free city." 
 Trade_2_mission_title:0 "Securing the Baltic" 
 Whaling_3_mission_title:0 "The expansion of the NKV" 
 Whaling_3_mission_desc:0 "With the enforcement and expansion of the NKV in full force, it has become clear that to enforce the monopoly in our island posesions, we must grant the NKV more powers to act on our behalf in enforcing the monopoly. Thus the day to day administration of Iceland as well as the Northern Isles will be shifted to the NKV, with them creating their own coast guard to enforce the monopoly. As concesion to the Icelandic whalers, and to get more of them on board with the monopoly, a corperate "Althing" will be established." 
 mission_nor.14.t:0 "The officialisation of the charter" 
 mission_nor.14.d:0 "The crown has announced that the islands of Iceland, Faraoe, Hjaltland and Orkneyar will be put under the administration of the NKV the ensure compliance with the monopoly and generate aditional revenue. As part of this agreement there will be an althing established for all whaler families to meet and air grievances to the company." 
 mission_nor.14.a:0 "We have no choice then" 
 Exploration_1_mission_title:0 "Recolonising greenland" 
 Exploration_1_mission_desc:0 "From the 10th to 14th century there was a Norse presence in Greenland, unfortunatly due too changes in climate, the settlement became untenable and the island was abandonned. Recent changes in the climate together with advances in our shipping capabilities have made permanent settlement of the island possible again. The crown has given the NKV the go-ahead with expanding opperations there." 
 F_M_3_mission_title:0 "Expanding the docks" 
 F_M_3_mission_desc:0 "With all the recent expansions of the mines as well as the increased supply of quality tiber, we have seen a boom in shipbuilding quality and quantity. We must capitalise on these gains." 
 Conquest_2_mission_title:0 "Personal union with Sweden" 
 Conquest_2_mission_desc:0 "With the reconquest of our lands, it has finally become time to integrate the rump of Sweden closer with our crown. Long live the union of Norway-Sweden!" 
 Whaling_barons_mission_title:0 "The whaling barons" 
 Whaling_barons_mission_desc:0 "Now that the NKV has been set up properly, a new class of influential merchants has risen within Norway. The so-called whaling barons make their wealth from the sale of the plethora of products made by the NKV, selling them all across Europe. They have now become such a powerfull force that we can no longer ignore them, and must lend our ear to their demands." 
 Colonise_greenland_mission_title:0 "The recolonisation of Greenland" 
 Colonise_greenland_mission_desc:0 "With the successfull recolonisation of Greenland, we will grant the now stable colony over to the NKV to set up more profitable whaling operations deeper into the atlantic." 
 Build_up_MP_mission_title:0 "Expanding the Mountain Palace" 
 Build_up_MP_mission_desc:0 "With the extra income from the new mines and ships, we can expand the royal mountain palace in Oppalanda. By hiring great sculptors and architects, we can make a palace so grand it will impress all who visit it, whilst still staying defensible for our military." 
 Great_expedition_mission_title:0 "The great voyage" 
 Great_expedition_mission_desc:0 "With the recent expansion into Greenland completed, we have been getting reports from the NKV that some of their whaling ships have sighted unknown landmasses off to the west of Greenland. These may be the legendary lands of the Saga of Erik the Red, long thought to be mere fiction, there might be truth to them after all. The crown will fund a fleet to go and explore these lands and confirm the reports." 
 
 #The great expedition
 GE_leaving_ships_tt:0 "§RThis option will leave 5 ships for the natives to use, but allow you to explore further up the river, unlocking a map of the great lakes at the end§!"
 GE_storage_capacity_explainer_tt:0 "§OOn this exploration trip, you will have 5 storage capacity, some decisions may take up some of this storage capacity, if it is full, you can't take any more stuff back home and some deciscions may become unavaliable§!"
 GE_storage_capacity_tt:0 "§OThis will take 1 storage capacity, you have [Root.GE_storage_space_left.GetValue] storage capacity left§!"
 GE_side_exploration_tt:0 "§RYou can only take one of 3 side explorations, and can't go back later. These are: The Hudson bay, The St. Lawrence river or going further along the New England coast§!"
 nor_great_expidition_tt:0 "This mission will start an event chain about exploring a part of the north american coastline. The greater the amount of ships you send (put in the province), the greater the rewards"
 nor_great_expidition.1.t:0 "The expedition sets off!"
 nor_great_expidition.1.d:0 "With the necessary ships gathered in the harbor of Reykjavik, the monrach themselves have arrived to wave the fleet off. The head of the NKV himself has elected to lead the fleet, and has left his duties to a, hopefully temporary, successor. The fleet now sets off towards the colony in greenland, where they will make a last stop and top up on supplies before heading off into the great unknown."
 nor_great_expidition.1.a:0 "Haul the anchors!"
 nor_great_expidition.2.t:0 "The last light of civilisation"
 nor_great_expidition.2.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 1: \n We have at last arrived in the Greenland colony. It was relativly smooth sailing from Iceland to here, with no major storms washing over us. The crew spent the time getting to know the ship's ins and outs whilst I studied any and all information we have of these lands we are heading too. From the accounts of whalers who saw coastlines, with some claiming to see silouetes of people on beaches. I have also read the translated Saga of Erik the Red, to try and discern if there is any usefull information that could help us. The description of the Skraelings in the Saga does match that of the sailors, so it could very well be that there are already inhabitants in this land. \n \n Captain's Journal, entry 2: \n We arrived a few days ago now and are almost done gathering and loading our supplies, but today I was aproached by the representative of some of the local whalers. He told me that they offered to join us on our journey, as they knew these seas well and several of them had reported seeing landmasses. I am now faced with the decisicion of letting these men on board with us, stretching our supply but allowing them to give us potentially usefull advice during the journey, or to deny them entery and save our supplies."
 nor_great_expidition.2.a:0 "Their advice could be valuable, take them on"
 nor_great_expidition.2.b:0 "Sorry, our supplies are stretched to thin"
 nor_great_expidition.3.t:0 "Helluland found!"
 nor_great_expidition.3.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 3: \n The saga is true! We have found an island slightly northwest of the western greenland settlement, which matches Erik the Red's description of Helluland. The island itself is unfortunatly rather empty, with only seals being spotted nearby. But, at specific spots on the island several sailors have found veins of minerals they think might be silver. The rocks gliter in the sunlight and are found sometimes laying on the ground, but mostly underground. I have now been asked to make a deciscion wether to excavate them or not."
 nor_great_expidition.3.a:0 "The whalers tell me this is no silver, but they did kill narwhals for their horns"
 nor_great_expidition.3.b:0 "We're rich! Start mining"
 nor_great_expidition.4.t:0 "A northern passage?"
 nor_great_expidition.4.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 4: \n We have moved on from Helluland further to the west, following a chain of similar islands we eventually reached what seems to be the enterance of a massive potential seaway! Though this land is slightly more hospitable than Helluland, we do not believe it to be Markland, seeing as there are far too few trees and it is much too far west for our ancestors to have gotten here. I now stand before a deciscion of wether we explore the potential seaway and perhaps find a way to asia by ship, or turn around to find Markland and keep our supplies for other explorations."
 nor_great_expidition.4.a:0 "The seaway seems intresting, lets go in there"
 nor_great_expidition.4.b:0 "The sea way isn't worth it, woud couldn't get to asia anyways"
 nor_side_expidition.1.t:0 "Beavers galore!"
 nor_side_expidition.1.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 5: \n We have arrived at what we suspect to be the southernmost inlet of the seaway, where the land has become much more hospitable. The seaway seems to be rather shallow and has a slight curvature all along its side, until a smaller bay forms in the south side. Along the banks some crewmates saw what they thought were people, but turned out to be beavers! and lots of them! The crew has now set out to hun these beavers for their pelts, as these can be quite valuable back home. There do seem to be some slight differences between these beavers and the ones back home, according to the naturalist we brought with us, but their pelts should still be plenty warm and valuable."
 nor_side_expidition.1.a:0 "These will make some nice coats"
 nor_side_expidition.2.t:0 "Not a seaway, but a bay"
 nor_side_expidition.2.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 6: \n It seems that we miscalculated, as this was infact a massive bay instead of a seaway to Asia. The coast slowly began curving upwards again after a while, which has led us to stop here and reconsider. If we want to have enough supplies for further exploration, we must turn around and cut our losses. Atleast our cartographers have mapped the coast of the bay, which will make setting up a pelting industry here easier."
 nor_side_expidition.2.a:0 "That's a shame"
 nor_great_expidition.5.t:0 "Markland found!"
 nor_great_expidition.5.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 7: \n We have managed to find what we think is Markland. The trees are plentifull here and the climate is similar to central Norway. But much more importantly, we have encountered the native Skraelings of this land! Whilst communication was rather strained when we encountered one of their hunting parties, they soon led us to their camp, where we discoverd, much to our surprise, a fellow Norwegian! It turned out that he was one of the whalers on a whaling ship we presumed sunk at sea. He told us that he managed to take one of the sloops and row towards the nearest landmass, which turned out to be this one. Here he was eventually picked up by the Skraelings and started living with them, eventually learning their language. He has offered to join us as a translator, together with one of the other tribesmen who knows many of the local languages of the other tribes, in return for being taken back to Norway at the end of the voyage."
 nor_great_expidition.5.a:0 "Sounds good, take him and his friend along"
 nor_great_expidition.6.t:0 "Finding Vinland"
 nor_great_expidition.6.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 9: \n We have at last arrived in the final land dictated in the saga of Erik the Red, Vinland. It is the most hospitable of the lands, being close to southern Norway in climate. What more, we have found the remains of what we suspect is a temporary settlement built by our ancestors. We will put this site to good use, leaving some of our crew and storm damaged ships behind to fish in the rich waters near here whilst the other part of the expedition moves on with the faster, non-damaged ships. On the return voyage we will stop here to pick up the repaired ships, crew and extra food supplies."
 nor_great_expidition.6.a:0 "Good luck, crew"
 nor_great_expidition.6.b:0 "Let the whalers go wild"
 nor_great_expidition.7.t:0 "Into the gulf"
 nor_great_expidition.7.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 9: \n From the coast of Vinland we could see a wide gulf leading further inland, which we decided to follow. Along the coast we saw many more unknown plants and animals, aswell as sometimes people. When we arrived at the end of the gulf, we found a rather large river flowing into it, with native tribes living around it's mouth. We traded a bit with these tribes for some supplies, but in general they were rather poor, though they did meantion larger tribes living upstream of the river, as well as some rather large lakes. I must now decide wether we spend the resources on exploring this river or not."
 nor_great_expidition.7.a:0 "Lets go up the river"
 nor_great_expidition.7.b:0 "Let's move on"
 nor_side_expidition.3.t:0 "Sailing up the St.Lawrence"
 nor_side_expidition.3.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 10: \n We have selected the highest sitting ships to sail up river with, with hopes of avoiding them bottoming out. All along the river we have found plenty more skrealings, with which we have traded many of our less valuable goods for basic supplies and diplomatic relations with them. We have managed to gain audiences with several chiefs, and exchanged gifts to gain diplomatic repute in the area. Several tribes have warned us against the violent nature of the natives further west, closer to the lakes, but so far we have only encountered peacfull Skrealings. We have now unfortunatly reached the point where our ships have started regularly bottoming out in the river, with only our smallest ships still being able to sail. Thankfully, the natives of this area have offered assistance in the form of lending us canoes and acompanying us to the so called great lakes, in return for leaving some of our smaller ships behind when we leave. It is now up to me to decide wether to accept this deal or not."
 nor_side_expidition.3.a:0 "Dock the ships, take the canoes"
 nor_side_expidition.3.b:0 "Leave our ships!? No, turn around"
 nor_side_expidition.4.t:0 "The great lakes"
 nor_side_expidition.4.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 11: \n We have arrived at the enterance to the great lakes on the canoes and light ships that could make it. The skrealings have guided us well, and some of our crew members even made some friends and learnt parts of their language, but they say they are not willing to guide us further, since the confederations around this part of the lake is rather agressive. As if right on cue, we were attacked by a lake-skrealing hunting party, but thankfully we managed to fend them off. This has however shook the crew, who now demand to return to the rest of the fleet. I have had to aquiesse, and we are returning to the rest of the fleet now. Still, the natives gave us detailed accounts of the shapes of the lakes and the other natives around them, which the cartographers have done their best to turn into maps of the region."
 nor_side_expidition.4.a:0 "Ah well, time to continue"
