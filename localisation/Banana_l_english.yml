 Whaling_1_mission_title:0 "The whalers of Norway" 
 Whaling_1_mission_desc:0 "For centuries whaling has been an integral part of the Norwegian way of life. But in the past few decades, the crown has shown more and more intresting in this industry, with the culmination of this being the monopolisaton of the whaling industry by the crown into the NKV." 
 F_M_1_mission_title:0 "The mines of Dalaskogen" 
 F_M_1_mission_desc:0 "The copper mines of Dalaskogen have been the economic center of our kingdom for centuries, producing most of the copper used within northern Europe and making us many riches. To expand on this success the crown has authorized the expansion of the mines into the surounding area." 
 Trade_1_mission_title:0 "The Northsea Trade" 
 Trade_1_mission_desc:0 "With our posesions all over the Northsea and our vassal of Iceland, the trade between them has only grown over the past centuries. We must make a final push to fully link the Northern Isles and Iceland to the mainlaind European economy. We will achieve this with the adoption of a new type of ship, the Caravel" 
 Whaling_2_mission_title:0 "Bigger ships, Bigger fish" 
 Whaling_2_mission_desc:0 "With the monopoly now firmly established, we must look into expanding the extraction rates of the industry. The easiest way to do this is to use our newly invented Caravels to increase the range and speed of our whaling fleet and allow it to catch bigger amounts of whales" 
 Navy_1_mission_title:0 "The great northern fleet" 
 Navy_1_mission_desc:0 "With our domain reaching out across the northern atlantic, we must have a fleet big and capable enough to defend all of our island posesions aswell as the long coast of mainland Norway" 
 F_M_2_mission_title:0 "Bigger mines, more wood" 
 F_M_2_mission_desc:0 "With the recent expansion of the Dalakogen mines, we now face a wood shortage. The extra tunnels that are being dug need wood for support beams, and the extra ore extraction needs to be spelted in furnaces with the help of charcoal. The crown has set out to expand forresting operations in the great forrests of eastern Norway." 
 Conquest_1_mission_title:0 "Reconquer lost lands" 
 Conquest_1_mission_desc:0 "With the Swedish incursions of the early 1400s, we lost some borderlands. This must be rectified" 
 Trade_2_mission_desc:0 "With our Northsea posesions now firmly integrated into the greater European economy, we must set our sights on the Baltic trade around the free city of Lübeck. This is after all where most of our goods flow too. We can either take some of this trade with agressive practices, or ally ourselves with the free city." 
 Trade_2_mission_title:0 "Securing the Baltic" 
 Whaling_3_mission_title:0 "The expansion of the NKV" 
 Whaling_3_mission_desc:0 "With the enforcement and expansion of the NKV in full force, it has become clear that to enforce the monopoly in our island posesions, we must grant the NKV more powers to act on our behalf in enforcing the monopoly. Thus the day to day administration of Iceland as well as the Northern Isles will be shifted to the NKV, with them creating their own coast guard to enforce the monopoly. As concesion to the Icelandic whalers, and to get more of them on board with the monopoly, a corperate "Althing" will be established." 
 mission_nor.14.t:0 "The officialisation of the charter" 
 mission_nor.14.d:0 "The crown has announced that the islands of Iceland, Faraoe, Hjaltland and Orkneyar will be put under the administration of the NKV the ensure compliance with the monopoly and generate aditional revenue. As part of this agreement there will be an althing established for all whaler families to meet and air grievances to the company." 
 mission_nor.14.a:0 "We have no choice then" 
 Exploration_1_mission_title:0 "Recolonising greenland" 
 Exploration_1_mission_desc:0 "From the 10th to 14th century there was a Norse presence in Greenland, unfortunatly due too changes in climate, the settlement became untenable and the island was abandonned. Recent changes in the climate together with advances in our shipping capabilities have made permanent settlement of the island possible again. The crown has given the NKV the go-ahead with expanding opperations there." 
 F_M_3_mission_title:0 "Expanding the docks" 
 F_M_3_mission_desc:0 "With all the recent expansions of the mines as well as the increased supply of quality tiber, we have seen a boom in shipbuilding quality and quantity. We must capitalise on these gains." 
 Conquest_2_mission_title:0 "Personal union with Sweden" 
 Conquest_2_mission_desc:0 "With the reconquest of our lands, it has finally become time to integrate the rump of Sweden closer with our crown. Long live the union of Norway-Sweden!" 
 Whaling_barons_mission_title:0 "The whaling barons" 
 Whaling_barons_mission_desc:0 "Now that the NKV has been set up properly, a new class of influential merchants has risen within Norway. The so-called whaling barons make their wealth from the sale of the plethora of products made by the NKV, selling them all across Europe. They have now become such a powerfull force that we can no longer ignore them, and must lend our ear to their demands." 
 Colonise_greenland_mission_title:0 "Recolonising Greenland" 
 Colonise_greenland_mission_desc:0 "With the successfull recolonisation of Greenland, we will grant the now stable colony over to the NKV to set up more profitable whaling operations deeper into the atlantic." 
 Build_up_MP_mission_title:0 "Expanding the Palace" 
 Build_up_MP_mission_desc:0 "With the extra income from the new mines and ships, we can expand the royal mountain palace in Oppalanda. By hiring great sculptors and architects, we can make a palace so grand it will impress all who visit it, whilst still staying defensible for our military." 
 Great_expedition_mission_title:0 "The great voyage" 
 Great_expedition_mission_desc:0 "With the recent expansion into Greenland completed, we have been getting reports from the NKV that some of their whaling ships have sighted unknown landmasses off to the west of Greenland. These may be the legendary lands of the Saga of Erik the Red, long thought to be mere fiction, there might be truth to them after all. The crown will fund a fleet to go and explore these lands and confirm the reports." 
 Whaling_4_mission_title:0 "Expanding the Coastguard"
 Whaling_4_mission_desc:0 "With the rediscovery of the new world and the European rush for it, it has become more important than ever to secure our oceanic claims for the whaling fleet and our passage to this new world. This has caused the crown to authorize a transfer of ships to the NKV for better patrolling of these seaways"
 Set_up_foothold_mission_title:0 "Setting up a foothold"
 Set_up_foothold_mission_desc:0 "With the return of the great voyage, we now have a new world to expand to and explore further. In the reports of the captain, it was made clear that the most suitable first candidate for permanent settlement is the island of Vinland. Not only is the climate familiar, it is one of the closest parts of the continent to us, and it has plentifull stocks of fish and whales to keep any potential colonists fed and drive economic output. We must stake a claim to the island and help the NKV set itself up there"
 Secure_atlantic_trade_mission_title:0 "The north atlantic trade"
 Secure_atlantic_trade_mission_desc:0 "Now that we have firmly established ourselves in Greenland and are starting up trade with the skraelings and colonists in the new world, we must invest in more infrastructure to prepare for the expansion of the north atlantic trading networks in the near future."
 NWC_colonial_mandate_mission_title:0 "The colonial mandate"
 NWC_colonial_mandate_mission_desc:0 "With our first colony established, it has become clear that to keep up with other European countries we must establish a rigirous organisation for colonising the new world and working together with the skraelings that live there. With the NKV already having experience with remote outposts, they are the perfect framework for such an organisation"
 Greater_expansion_mission_title:0 "Expanding the colonies"
 Greater_expansion_mission_desc:0 "The success of out colonial ventures has been promising, but to truly establish a presence in the new world we must expand to the mainland coast and ally ourselves with the local skralings. They have shown themselves knowledgable of these lands and they can be usefull allies in the setteling of these lands."

Freed from the heavy aristocratic control of the mainland economy, in the new world several enterprising burghers have managed to set up combined corperate enteties under the guise of the NKV, with the AMC being the most profitable one. The crown has expressed intrest in funding these new corperations and has promised to keep out the nobility in return for more control and a share of the profits."

 Chamber_of_churches_mission_desc:0 "In an effort to contain and use the growing radicalism of the now semi-independent churhces all over Norway, the crown has called together all bishops in the capital to establish a yearly council of churches to jointly decide on religious matters within Norway. In a bid to weaken the nobility, and too get the churches to agree with this, the crown has promised any churches that atend restoration of tax exempt status and de-jure independence of church lands from noble duchies and counties, making them direct vassals of the crown instead of subordinate to the noblity."
 Explorers_society_mission_title:0 "The Explorers Society"
 Explorers_society_mission_desc:0 "After the great voyage, the amount of independently funded explorations has gone up massivly. This has now reached an unignorable magnitude, and the crown has decreed the creation of an official society for the catalouging and organising of these expeditions. All Explorers will need to become members of this society, and deliver it rapports of their explorations, and in return the crown has agreed to fund part of their expeditions and make diplomatic dealings on their behalf."

Whilst nowadays our navy is well staffed with experienced seamen and whalers, the same can not be said for our airships. Due to the fact that the airships can only carry so much weight, everything has to be optemised for weight as much as possible. Together with the fact that manouvering these balloons is no easy task, we have reached the conclusion that a similar system to that of the old Leidang system needs to be implemented to allow the military to call up excperienced and light airship men for service in times of need."

No, we have on top of all these achievements also managed to conquer the skies themselves as our domain! Nothing can stop us now, the sky is literally our limit!

 The_royal_althing_mission_desc:0 "The chamber of churches has been a hallmark in Norwegian policy for centuries now, and ever since their inception they have been acruing more and more power, sometimes by choice of the monarch to disempower the nobility further, sometimes by their own demands. The churches have now turned into defacto representatives of the population, with some of them even adopting more public participation in the selection of who to send to the chamber of churches. The chamber has now come to the crown with a radical proposal, though being closer to a demand in some eyes. They want to solidify the role of the council of churches and to do this they have suggested introducing a constitution to determin which duties lay with the chamber, and which with the crown. They have also, as concesion to the nobles, pushed for the creation of an upper house comprised of said nobles. Whilst this is an unprecedented proposal, with the revolutionary fervor brewing all around us this may be the only way to calm the masses. After all, the crown would still keep far reaching powers like a complete veto and the crown monopolies stay intact. What's the worst that could happen?"

 nor_great_expidition.2.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 1: \nWe have at last arrived in the Greenland colony. It was relativly smooth sailing from Iceland to here, with no major storms washing over us. The crew spent the time getting to know the ship's ins and outs whilst I studied any and all information we have of these lands we are heading too. From the accounts of whalers who saw coastlines, with some claiming to see silouetes of people on beaches. I have also read the translated Saga of Erik the Red, to try and discern if there is any usefull information that could help us. The description of the Skraelings in the Saga does match that of the sailors, so it could very well be that there are already inhabitants in this land. \n \nCaptain's Journal, entry 2: \nWe arrived a few days ago now and are almost done gathering and loading our supplies, but today I was aproached by the representative of some of the local whalers. He told me that they offered to join us on our journey, as they knew these seas well and several of them had reported seeing landmasses. I am now faced with the decisicion of letting these men on board with us, stretching our supply but allowing them to give us potentially usefull advice during the journey, or to deny them entery and save our supplies."

We have found an island slightly northwest of the western greenland settlement, which matches Erik the Red's description of Helluland. The island itself is unfortunatly rather empty, with only seals being spotted nearby. But, at specific spots on the island several sailors have found veins of minerals they think might be silver. The rocks gliter in the sunlight and are found sometimes laying on the ground, but mostly underground. I have now been asked to make a deciscion wether to excavate them or not."

 nor_great_expidition.4.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 4: \nWe have moved on from Helluland further to the west, following a chain of similar islands we eventually reached what seems to be the enterance of a massive potential seaway! Though this land is slightly more hospitable than Helluland, we do not believe it to be Markland, seeing as there are far too few trees and it is much too far west for our ancestors to have gotten here. I now stand before a deciscion of wether we explore the potential seaway and perhaps find a way to asia by ship, or turn around to find Markland and keep our supplies for other explorations."

 nor_side_expidition.1.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 5: \nWe have arrived at what we suspect to be the southernmost inlet of the seaway, where the land has become much more hospitable. The seaway seems to be rather shallow and has a slight curvature all along its side, until a smaller bay forms in the south side. Along the banks some crewmates saw what they thought were people, but turned out to be beavers! and lots of them! The crew has now set out to hun these beavers for their pelts, as these can be quite valuable back home. There do seem to be some slight differences between these beavers and the ones back home, according to the naturalist we brought with us, but their pelts should still be plenty warm and valuable."

 nor_side_expidition.2.t:0 "Not a seaway, but a bay"
 nor_side_expidition.2.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 6: \nIt seems that we miscalculated, as this was infact a massive bay instead of a seaway to Asia. The coast slowly began curving upwards again after a while, which has led us to stop here and reconsider. If we want to have enough supplies for further exploration, we must turn around and cut our losses. Atleast our cartographers have mapped the coast of the bay, which will make setting up a pelting industry here easier."

 nor_great_expidition.5.t:0 "Markland found!"
 nor_great_expidition.5.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 7: \nWe have managed to find what we think is Markland. The trees are plentifull here and the climate is similar to central Norway. But much more importantly, we have encountered the native Skraelings of this land! Whilst communication was rather strained when we encountered one of their hunting parties, they soon led us to their camp, where we discoverd, much to our surprise, a fellow Norwegian! It turned out that he was one of the whalers on a whaling ship we presumed sunk at sea. He told us that he managed to take one of the sloops and row towards the nearest landmass, which turned out to be this one. Here he was eventually picked up by the Skraelings and started living with them, eventually learning their language. He has offered to join us as a translator, together with one of the other tribesmen who knows many of the local languages of the other tribes, in return for being taken back to Norway at the end of the voyage."

It is the most hospitable of the lands, being close to southern Norway in climate. What more, we have found the remains of what we suspect is a temporary settlement built by our ancestors. We will put this site to good use, leaving some of our crew and storm damaged ships behind to fish in the rich waters near here whilst the other part of the expedition moves on with the faster, non-damaged ships. On the return voyage we will stop here to pick up the repaired ships, crew and extra food supplies."

 nor_great_expidition.7.d:0 "Captain's Journal, entry 9: \nFrom the coast of Vinland we could see a wide gulf leading further inland, which we decided to follow. Along the coast we saw many more unknown plants and animals, aswell as sometimes people. When we arrived at the end of the gulf, we found a rather large river flowing into it, with native tribes living around it's mouth. We traded a bit with these tribes for some supplies, but in general they were rather poor, though they did meantion larger tribes living upstream of the river, as well as some rather large lakes. I must now decide wether we spend the resources on exploring this river or not."

All along the river we have found plenty more skrealings, with which we have traded many of our less valuable goods for basic supplies and diplomatic relations with them. We have managed to gain audiences with several chiefs, and exchanged gifts to gain diplomatic repute in the area. Several tribes have warned us against the violent nature of the natives further west, closer to the lakes, but so far we have only encountered peacfull Skrealings. We have now unfortunatly reached the point where our ships have started regularly bottoming out in the river, with only our smallest ships still being able to sail. Thankfully, the natives of this area have offered assistance in the form of lending us canoes and acompanying us to the so called great lakes, in return for leaving some of our smaller ships behind when we leave. It is now up to me to decide wether to accept this deal or not."

The skrealings have guided us well, and some of our crew members even made some friends and learnt parts of their language, but they say they are not willing to guide us further, since the confederations around this part of the lake is rather agressive. As if right on cue, we were attacked by a lake-skrealing hunting party, but thankfully we managed to fend them off. This has however shook the crew, who now demand to return to the rest of the fleet. I have had to aquiesse, and we are returning to the rest of the fleet now. Still, the natives gave us detailed accounts of the shapes of the lakes and the other natives around them, which the cartographers have done their best to turn into maps of the region."

After some initial confusion, the crew tried to climb down to stop them, but several of the warriors that stayed back started pelting the scrambeling crew with arrows and javelins. Soon after we started shooting back from bellow deck with our cannons, which scarred the skrealings away, but they still did quite a bit of damage to a few of our ships. This required us to seek refuge in a sheltered bay a bit further east. Here we encountered more skrealings, but this time of the peacfull kind. They, who call themselves the Mikmaq, had seen us come to land with damaged ships and came over to help. Within a few days we got the most extreme damage repaired. The skraelings then aproached me with an offer to exchange gifts and feast with them. I must now choose wether to accept this offer, and lose some of our cargo space to take their gifts, or to move on and anger the tribe."

It turned out that these were completely different from ours, with our armour protecting our soldiers from most of their weapons in the first place, the battle was already almost won by the time they were close enough to the shore for our cannons to reach. We fired a first volley, which scarred the enemy so much that it sent them right into a rout and the day was won.

 mission_nor.9.t:0 "Launching Project Selvvind"
 mission_nor.9.d:0 "With the recent release of the crown from day-to-day governing, a boom in funding of scientific endevours has taken place in an effort to find new sources of funding from the crown monopolies. One of the inventors that came with a proposal to the crown was an engineer from Iceland. He has lived his whole life around geysers, and recently spent several years studying them and how they work. He now believes he can create an artificial source of mechanical movement powered only by the heat of burning coals, being inspired by the steam formation that happens in geysers until it spews out with force, he wants to do something similar with an enclosed vessle and a piston. He promises this invention could allow our airships to finaly propell themselves independently from being drawn or riding the wind, allowing for much more freedom of motion. This has piqued the intrest of the crown and they have granted him funding to start working on his project."
 mission_nor.9.a:0 "Well then, get to work!"
 mission_nor.10.t:0 "The success of Project Selvvind!"
 mission_nor.10.d:0 "After many years of toil, the inventor has anounced a successfull test of aerial populsion using one of his steam engines. This will revolutionise our airship travel! Unfortunatly, whilst the crown would have had the pattent for 20 years, the parliament has decided to grant the pattent to the inventor himself insted, who refused to sell the exclusive rights to the crown and instead made the technology publicaly avaliable. This has been a setback, but the crown has still set up the first large scale production plant with the inventors's help, and will reap the benefits for a long time."
