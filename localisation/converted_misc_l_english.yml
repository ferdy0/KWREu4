The Council, always ready to expand their influence, have chosen the closest relative in line, which is none other than the King of Africa. He is currently on the way to Cagliari for the coronation ceremony, but our local nobles are openly opposing this decision, quoting the fact that our new ruler will be Levantine, and angry about that new power grab by the Council. \nIt seems that the situation is spiraling out of control, and the nobles are starting an open rebellion, calling other Lacon-Gunale branches for help in Naples and Provence. The King of Africa quickly converting to Catholicism didn't help..."

 tyrhennia_civil_war.9.t:0 "An Opportunity..."
 tyrhennia_civil_war.9.d:0 "With the civil war spiraling out of control, even the all-mighty Council has decided to send their private militia to try to help quell the revolts. This gives us an opportunity to discreetly get rid of them, in a 'rebel ambush', and thus weaken the power of Council on the Crown."

 tyrhennia_civil_war.100.a:0 "Thank God it's over."
 tyrhennia_civil_war.12.t:0 "The Secret Conversion"
 tyrhennia_civil_war.12.d:0 "With the War of the Doves now behind us, it seems now that the king of Africa, and now our king, had not actually converted to Catholicism, and used all these years of peace to slowly and discreetly convert the upper classes of society to Levantine. This has now permeated long enough that he has declared a new state religion."

 tyrhennia_civil_war.57.d:0 "Since times immemorial, the Knights Hospitaliers have found residence on our islands, treating the pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land. They have been very important to our cultural and economic developpement, and it has been tradition that at least one of the Archon's sons would join them and serve their Grandmaster. Our first son wishes to perpetuate that tradition, but that is also our only son, and this move would leave our Grand Archonate without a direct heir."
 tyrhennia_civil_war.57.a:0 "So be it, God wills it"
 tyrhennia_civil_war.57.b:0 "We cannot risk the stability of the kingdom"
