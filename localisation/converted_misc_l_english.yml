 tyrhennia_civil_war.12.t:0 "The Secret Conversion"
 tyrhennia_civil_war.12.d:0 "With the War of the Doves now behind us, it seems now that the king of Africa, and now our king, had not actually converted to Catholicism, and used all these years of peace to slowly and discreetly convert the upper classes of society to Levantine.
